## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also specifically applies when:
- Contributing code related to medical functionality
- Discussing medical practices or procedures
- Sharing healthcare-related knowledge or experiences
- Interacting with healthcare professionals
- Representing the project in healthcare or academic contexts

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

- **Primary Contact**: [@naimackerman](https://github.com/naimackerman)
- **Secondary Contact**: [@mansurarief](https://github.com/mansurarief)
- **Email**: Contact through GitHub profiles or repository issues

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior, medical misinformation, or privacy violations.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
Also applies to serious medical misinformation that could harm patients or
severe privacy violations.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Medical Ethics Considerations

This project involves medical software that could impact patient care. Therefore:

### Additional Responsibilities
- Contributors should consider the Hippocratic Oath principle "First, do no harm"
- Code changes that affect medical functionality require extra scrutiny
- Medical accuracy takes precedence over technical convenience
- Patient safety considerations should guide all decisions

### Reporting Medical Issues
If you discover issues that could affect patient safety or medical accuracy:

1. **Immediate reporting**: Contact maintainers immediately
2. **Detailed documentation**: Provide specific examples and potential impact
3. **Constructive solutions**: Suggest fixes or improvements when possible
4. **Follow-up**: Ensure issues are resolved before release

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you may appeal by:

1. **Contacting maintainers**: Reach out to project maintainers
2. **Providing evidence**: Include relevant context and evidence
3. **Professional tone**: Maintain a respectful, professional approach
4. **Patience**: Allow time for thorough review

Appeals will be reviewed by uninvolved community leaders when possible.
