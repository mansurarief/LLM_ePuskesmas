# Privacy Policy for Medical Notetaking for ePuskesmas

**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how "Medical Notetaking for ePuskesmas" ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Chrome extension (the "Extension").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. User-Generated Content
We collect the data you explicitly provide or enable the Extension to caption/transcribe, including:
- **Audio Data:** When you use the recording feature, audio data is processed to generate transcriptions.
- **Text Input & Notes:** Any notes, corrections, or text you enter into the Extension.
- **Page Content:** The Extension may access the content of the active tab (via the `activeTab` permission) solely for the purpose of integrating notes with the ePuskesmas system or relevant medical records you are viewing.

### B. Technical Information
We may collect minimal technical information required for the operation of the Extension, such as error logs or API status statuses.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:
- **Service Provision:** To transcribe audio, generate summaries, and facilitate note-taking within the ePuskesmas environment.
- **Processing:** Audio and text data may be sent to third-party AI providers (specifically OpenAI and Google Gemini) for the sole purpose of transcription and summarization.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We share your data only with specific service providers necessary to provide the Extension's core functionality:

- **OpenAI:** We send audio/text data to OpenAI via their API for transcription and processing. You can review OpenAI's Privacy Policy at [https://openai.com/privacy](https://openai.com/privacy).
- **Google Gemini (Google AI):** We send data to Google's generative AI services for processing. You can review Google's Privacy Policy at [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

These providers process data on our behalf and are subject to confidentiality obligations.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage:** Your settings, notes, and temporary transcripts are stored locally on your device using Chrome's `storage` API. This data does not leave your browser unless you explicitly export it or it is being processed by the AI providers mentioned above.
- **Security:** We prioritize the security of your data. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## 5. Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access:** View the data stored locally in the Extension.
- **Delete:** Clear your local data through the Extension's settings or by uninstalling the Extension.
